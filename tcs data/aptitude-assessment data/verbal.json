The theory is that regularly switching between languages exercises the brain's executive function, building what scientists call 'cognitive reserve.' This doesn't prevent dementia pathology but appears to help the brain compensate for damage, allowing it to function normally for longer despite underlying disease progression.'

This highlights the powerful connection between mind and body in healing processes.' What does the passage suggest is responsible for the placebo effect?",

Proponents argue that this approach offers numerous benefits: fresher, more nutritious food; reduced environmental impact due to shorter transportation distances; support for local economies; and greater transparency in food production. Critics, however, point out that local isn't always more sustainable, as farming methods matter more than distance traveled, and that such systems may not scale efficiently to feed large urban populations.'
